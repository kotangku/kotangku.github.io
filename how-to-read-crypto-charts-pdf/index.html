<p>In other words, every time you buy or sell a share of the coin, it is considered as volume. In this guide, you will learn how to read charts, and how to use some basic technical analysis tools that you can use to help you make trading decisions. Bitcoinwisdom is totally free cryptocurrency charting website, that includes all the key exchanges such as bitmex, deribit, kraken, binance and coinbase pro. Hammer has a small body, it occurs when the price is dead. So even if a coin is bought instead of sold, volume will increase either way.</p>

<p>My advice is to first start following the price of bitcoin and your other favorite coins daily. This implies that the crypto candlesticks will show all of the transactions that took place in the selected time frame. Open your mt4 or mt5 charts. If a trader buys gbp/usd for 1.6000 and then later on sells it for 1.6020, that�s a difference of 0.0020 or 20 pips. Hammer has a small body, it occurs when the price is dead.</p>
