<p>Kin was introduced to the market exactly 3 years back in september 2017 with price of 1 kin at $0.000103 usd. Click on it and type in kin, you should see kin/btc, select that pair and you should see a price chart of kin/btc in the middle of the page. I was wondering if yall knew of any good apps or reliable sites.i just started to get into crypto and sorry for writing so much i have to or else it gets deleted i guess. The kin project was first launched on the ethereum blockchain as an erc20 enabled token. Frankly, the best way to buy kin (kin) or any other cryptocurrency (altcoin) is to find a reliable and reputable exchange, and then purchase the crypto of your choice.</p>
