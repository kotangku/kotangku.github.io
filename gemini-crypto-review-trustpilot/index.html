<p>Gemini excellence after reading the pile of hateful reviews, decided to give their app a try and see for myself. Research the crypto market, buy bitcoin and other cryptos with gemini�s. To start some serious trading, i attempted to deposit 25,000 aud, and after waiting a ridiculous 2 weeks, i was notified by my bank that the payment got rejected by the beneficiary bank telling them that the bank details were incorrect. I used gemini a couple of years ago, and the support was excellent, however, that is not the case now. All of the reviews here resonate all the elements which are wrong, but, they are no different to coinbase and binance, infact binance is the worst.</p>

<p>There are a number of factors to take into account when deciding which crypto exchange is right for you. Gemini is a very useless and fraudulent site crytop site please do not use it for your own good, they made me do a wire transfer of $10,000 and then froze my account and refuse to refund the money back to my bank account, no good support team, very terrible site, going to. The security is incredible and really boosts the exchange’s credibility. Gemini is a cryptocurrency exchange, digital wallet, and custodian to securely store crypto and easily buy and sell cryptocurrencies. Let�s see how gemini stacks up against popular competitors.</p>
