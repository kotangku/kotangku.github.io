<p>Kraken currently offers up to 5x leverage. In order to trade with leverage you put up a fraction of the amount you want to trade as collateral (typically known as margin) and the broker will lend you the rest. In a nutshell, trading on leverage allows you to invest more than you have in your brokerage account. Leverage trading or margin trading fundamentally means the borrowing of funds to increase your bet while you trade. With a lever you can lift anything, provided the spot is firm enough.</p>

<p>In doing so, you are effectively borrowing funds from the broker in question. Leverage trading or margin trading fundamentally means the borrowing of funds to increase your bet while you trade. If deployed as part of a responsible trading strategy, margin trading doesn’t just increase your position in a specific trade, but can also help diversify your portfolio, allowing you to hedge or arbitrage across multiple positions without depositing additional capital. Hopefully, you learned all the basics of leverage trading principles and the pros and cons of leverage trading. Most likely, you’ve already learned the basics of crypto trading, and are even pretty good at it!</p>
