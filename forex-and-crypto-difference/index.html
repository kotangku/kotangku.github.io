<p>Blockchain technologies made crypto transactions very simple and highly anonymous. Forex, like crypto, involves trading currencies. Crypto trading will need a few more years to build a reputation, which gives forex trading an edge over crypto trading. Gemini crypto platform offers excellent account management options. One of the critical differences between crypto and forex trading is the fact that forex trading requires a broker to facilitate it.</p>

<p>Crypto trading, just like forex, involves trading currencies. There is also one other significant difference between forex and crypto; Last, but not least, is the daily traded volume of the two markets. The crypto market is newer in comparison with the more established forex market, which has a rich history. Forex is a much older market, and it has the highest trading volume of any global market.</p>
