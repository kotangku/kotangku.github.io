<p>It’s time to change the dynamics of the game while moving away from the traditional approach to a more nuanced approach. Upland is one of the new generation games that uses blockchain for the representation of the ownerships from the players. The best known are decentraland, cryptovoxels, somnium space and the sandbox, where virtual real estate prices are hitting new highs. Get deeper insights on your investments on spectral crypto, get connected to your account/fund managers, meet your tenants and get more out of a single platform. This game is quite player friendly in terms of its value increase model.</p>

<p>However, crypto is flipping the script on everything from commercial to residential. Every transaction will be made via smart contracts on the ethereum blockchain and, as soon as you buy some real estate property, you will be able to set the new price. This difference between this project and other online games that have a similar concept is that upland has a cool lama as their mascot. In other words, a real estate property is split up into a certain number of parts. The first 5 new team mates to join myland virtual real estate clan will each receive a smol surprise gift of xtm cryptocurrency for joining, as an added bonus on top of what you got for signing up to my upland team.</p>

<p>This difference between this project and other online games that have a similar concept is that upland has a cool lama as their mascot. This game is quite player friendly in terms of its value increase model. Decentraland has seen more than us$50 million in total sales, including land, avatars, usernames and wearables such as virtual outfits. The real estate part is no more than a part of the game. Part of the surge in volume is likely due to a big virtual “land sale” going on in the sandbox.</p>
