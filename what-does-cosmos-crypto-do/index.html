<p>Always back up your seed words and be sure to store them in a secure location. I keep hearing about it. Cosmos is a decentralised network of independent blockchains that can scale and operate together, enabling an ecosystem of interconnected applications and services. You can plug every blockchain device into the cosmos hub by establishing a new region, and transfer tokens between those zones back and forth without the need for an intermediary. Cosmos may communicate with many other apps and coins, something that other blockchains can’t do well. I am new to cosmos community and have just recently started to stake my atom on cosmostation.</p>

As the crypto community learns more about cosmos, what it brings to the table and what that means for crypto in general, then we will see more people buying into cosmos because they believe in it as a tech vs folks looking to make a quick pump and dump profit.
