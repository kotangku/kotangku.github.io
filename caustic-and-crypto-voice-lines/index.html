<p>The line in question is said by crypto, with the scientist calling caustic a dirty rat. The line in question is said by crypto, with the scientist calling caustic a dirty rat. I unboxed the new bangalore heirloom!! Apex legends voice lines,apex legends season 7,apex legends,voice lines,apex legends caustic and crypto connection,apex legends season 5,apex legends wattson and crypto voice lines,apex legends. I have no further time to deal with you. [to crypto or wattson] every moment i spent on you distracts me from a greater purpose. [to crypto] how does it feel, knowing you�re nothing without someone else picking you up? [to crypto] dragged from gutter once again.</p>

<p>An inappropriate voice line between caustic and crypto was removed in the september 03, 2020 patch; And as for that inappropriate caustic voice line, let�s just say you won�t hear him talk about rodents around crypto anymore. The line in question is said by crypto, with the scientist calling caustic a dirty rat. Their dialogue would be cold and against one another, very unwilling to work together, but have to. The relationship between crypto and watson took some hits as watson still thinks that crypto is the mole.</p>
