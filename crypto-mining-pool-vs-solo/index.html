<p>Quite sad, but we had no other options. When our zec solo mining pool just launched, it needed some testing. It is also demoralizing when you donât find a block for a long duration. All things considered, it may be better to mine solo if your available hashrate provides a low enough block mining time. Pool mining tool below will help you determine this for a number of popular cryptocurrencies.</p>

<p>Use solo mining only if you could find few blocks daily. The probability of finding blocks is lower when you are solo mining. Solo mining used to be a thing in dawn of the cryptocurrencies. Since blocks are found randomly and miners are rewarded directly from blocks found, the poolï¿½s luck will affect the minerï¿½s earnings variances. At the same time, the reward for the found block goes entirely to one miner.</p>
