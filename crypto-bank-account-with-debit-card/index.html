<p>Powered by mastercard, the card is accepted globally to pay or withdraw at over 30 million locations worldwide. And yes, there are now even crypto credit card options available to those who wish to borrow against their cryptocurrency assets and have the ability to spend them wherever visa or mastercard is accepted. A cryptocurrency debit card is a payment card that works like a bank debit card or prepaid card, but when a consumer uses it, they spend from a bitcoin or other crypto balance instead of a checking account denominated in their local fiat currency. You can either enter the crypto amount you wish to transfer, or the specific eur amount you. In addition, simplex will allow a “top up” feature to be implemented in the application so that users can use bitcoin, ethereum, and usdt as funds in the debit card and coti bank account.</p>
